# JSON Editor Approach for Varchiver

This document outlines the strategy for handling JSON data within the Varchiver application, particularly for the JSON editor feature.

## Core Requirements:

1.  **Schema Validation**:
    *   Allow users to load a JSON schema.
    *   Validate the currently loaded JSON document against this schema.
    *   Display clear validation errors or success messages.
    *   Support for a default schema (e.g., for the tech item inventory).
2.  **Large File Handling (Progressive Enhancement)**:
    *   **Initial Goal**: Gracefully handle moderately large JSON files (e.g., `sample_items_big.json`) that can be loaded into memory.
    *   **Medium-Term Goal**: Support files that are too large for in-memory parsing by `json.load()` but can still be processed by streaming parsers if the editor only needs to show parts of it or if the structure is amenable (e.g., JSON Lines).
    *   **Long-Term Goal (Ambitious)**: Explore strategies for editing extremely large files (approaching 1GB or more, or "1 billion lines" if structured as many small records). This would likely involve:
        *   Streaming parsers (e.g., `ijson`).
        *   Virtual tree views that only load visible portions of the data.
        *   Indexed access or specialized data backends if random access and editing are required for huge files.
3.  **Schema Inference (User Idea)**:
    *   **Concept**: If no explicit schema is loaded, attempt to infer a basic structural schema from the first record (or a sample of records) in the JSON data.
    *   **Comparison**: Use this inferred schema to highlight inconsistencies or structural differences in subsequent records.
    *   **Limitations**: This would be a "best-effort" structural check, not as robust as a formal JSON schema. It would primarily identify missing/extra keys or basic type mismatches.

## Implementation Phases:

### Phase 1: Basic Editor with Formal Schema Validation (Current Focus)

*   Use `QTreeWidget` for displaying JSON structure.
*   Load entire JSON document into memory using `json.load()`.
*   Integrate `jsonschema` library for validation against a user-provided schema file.
*   Implement UI for loading schema, triggering validation, and displaying results.

### Phase 2: Handling Larger Files & Initial Schema Inference

*   **Streaming for Read/Validation**:
    *   Investigate using a streaming parser like `ijson` for validation of larger files without loading the entire document into memory. This would make validation feasible for larger files even if editing is still memory-bound.
    *   The tree view might still only show a portion of the data or a summary if the file is too large to fully display.
*   **First Record Schema Inference**:
    *   Implement logic to parse the first object in a JSON array (or the root object if not an array).
    *   Generate a simple structural "schema" (e.g., a list of keys and their observed Python types).
    *   Add a feature to iterate through subsequent records (if an array) and compare their structure against this inferred schema, highlighting differences. This is primarily for JSON Lines-like structures or arrays of similar objects.

### Phase 3: Advanced Large File Editing & UI (Future)

*   **Virtual Tree Model**: Replace `QTreeWidget` with `QTreeView` and a custom `QAbstractItemModel` that implements on-demand loading of data from disk.
*   **Streaming Parser for Editing**: For true large file editing, modifications would likely need to be applied by reading the stream, making changes, and writing to a new file, or by using techniques that allow in-place modification if the file format/structure allows.
*   **Indexing**: For very large files where random access to elements is needed (not just sequential display), an indexing mechanism might be required. This could involve pre-processing the file to build an index of object/array start and end positions.

## Default Schema for Tech Items:

*   The JSON editor should ideally have a way to load the specific schema for `sample_items_big.json` by default or make it easily accessible.
*   This schema needs to be defined in JSON Schema format.

## Notes on "1 Billion Lines":

*   A single JSON document with 1 billion lines (if each line is a new element or part of a structure) would be exceptionally large and likely impractical to edit as a whole in a simple text or tree editor.
*   If this refers to a **JSON Lines** format (`.jsonl`), where each line is an independent JSON object, then processing becomes much more feasible by reading and processing line by line. The "infer schema from first record and compare" approach is well-suited for this.
*   Clarity on the structure of such a large file is important for choosing the right strategy.

This document will be updated as the implementation progresses and new challenges or ideas emerge.
